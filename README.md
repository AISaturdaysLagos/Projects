## Cohort 1 Projects

The project was about exploring the different deeplearning frameworks. We grouped our students into 5 groups, namely TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, Neon and Theano.

1. Group PyTorch led by George Igwegbe. Other team members include Ezerioha Somtochukwu, Ayodeji Oluwajoba, Chidi, Seun Lawal and Victor O.\
